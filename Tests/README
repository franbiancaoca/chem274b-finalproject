This subdirectory tests C++ implementations of 
a cellular automata that can be used for general purpose.
In this case, we are modeling allele frequencies over generations of a population.

LIST OF FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY:
- README: (is this file)

- Makefile: Shortcut commands that allows for creation of executables to run test programs. 

- test_genotype.cpp: C++ implementation of a cellular automata that models allele frequencies over 
generations of a population.
